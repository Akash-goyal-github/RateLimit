**API Rate Limiting Solution**

Problem Statement:

We need to interact with an API that enforces a strict limit of 15 calls per minute. Exceeding this limit results in a penalty of an additional minute during which no further calls can be made. 
The API is defined as follows:
function String callme(String input);

Proposed Solution:

1. Utilizing Rate Limits
To stay within the safe limits, we implement a rate limiter on the server side based on the client making the requests. This ensures that individual clients do not exceed the predefined threshold.

2. Handling Excess Calls
If we attempt to call the API 20 times within a minute, we would exceed the rate limit. To manage this, we can introduce a client-side queue that ensures the API is only called up to 15 times per minute.
Any additional calls will be queued and executed after the appropriate waiting period.

4. API Design Considerations
If I were the API designer, I would implement the following:

Rate Limiter: A robust rate-limiting mechanism that monitors client requests and applies penalties appropriately.
Client-Level Rate Limits: Rate limits should be enforced per client, allowing other clients to continue making requests without being impacted by one client exceeding their limit.
Example API Call
You can test the API rate limiting using the following curl command:
```
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/api/call?input=Request1' \
--header 'client: akash1'
```

In this implementation, we apply a client-level rate limit. If a single client sends more than 15 requests within a minute, the client will experience a one-minute waiting period before making further requests. 
Other clients will continue to function as usual without interruption.
